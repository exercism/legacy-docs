# Code Review

We have found that people's opinions on code review and feedback are largely determined by the quality of the feedback, specifically with regard to the level of respect and pragmatism by the person providing feedback.

In our explorations, fear and irritation both ranked as equally negative emotions that must be mitigated.

As such, one of the key requirements for Exercism's success is how to ensure that feedback is:
- Timely
- Friendly
- Respectful
- Pragmatic
- Provided with an adequate knowledge of the language
- Provided with an understanding of the exercise

Exercism is traditionally built around community-based moderation where anyone can feedback on another's exercise. One of our key areas of discussion has been to establish if that is a model that will provide feedback that meets with the goals listed about, or if the giving of feedback should be limited to a subset of users who are trained in this skill. In this document we describe these users as "mentors".

In having this discussion we listed the pros of mentor-only feedback and community-feedback.

### Pros of mentor-only feedback

We've grouped the benefits into different categories.

#### Quality
- The quality of the feedback will be consistently much higher
- The quality of tone will be consistently much higher
- We can give feedback on the feedback and the mentor will expect/appreciate that
- We can ensure that people giving feedback know the things we want them to know about feedback
- We can stop bad behaviors, patterns, and feedback as part of a process, not something that feels vindictive or elitist
- Mentors will be invested in understanding the exercises better
- Mentors will be invested in improving feedback
- Feedback from different people will be more consistent
- The person who receives feedback can be more confident that the feedback is worth acting on
- The person who receives the feedback will likely prefer to get feedback from a "mentor", not a "rando"

#### Processes
- Our internal systems for feedback can be hackier/experimental, as we're working with a trusted group of people who can input on that.
- Mentors will be able to compare notes and synthesize learnings.
- There is a clearer separation of mentoring as a skill, and language-knowledge as a skill, and we can train the two things separately.
- It's quicker to ramp up to mentoring in a new language track, because you already have the mentoring skills, even if you don't have the language skills right off the bat.

#### Normal Site Usage
- A user doesn’t feel pressure to start giving feedback right away
- A user doesn’t feel a responsibility to mentor in a new language
- At the end of a track users may feel like they've achieved something more tangible

#### Aspiration
- If mentoring on Exercism is respected and exciting people will be motivated to get the privilege
- At the end of a track, there is a "next step" to become a mentor, which means it doesn't end with the last exercise
- Mentors explicitly get skills that are transferrable to other contexts and platforms

#### Marketing (Benefits to Exercism?)
- Mentors might be involved in other projects (e.g. bootcamps) where they can use (and promote) Exercism to a wider audience
- We can showcase mentors on a track to make it feel more exciting and valuable
- It will feel like a much richer learning experience (you can get feedback from anyone on any website on the internet)
- We are more likely to get top people giving feedback
- Users will trust the product and process more and will therefore likely give more to it
- It plays into the 1% rule (1% super users, 9% users, 90% rarely use it)

### Pros of Community Feedback
- Everyone learns through teaching
- We might get very surprising insights from people who haven't been "polluted" by our ideas about feedback
- Variety of feedback might improve quality of feedback
- More people giving feedback might mean that more people get feedback
- We send the message implicitly that Exercism is about giving as well as taking
- There's no barrier to someone getting involved
- It's not elitist
- More people might build friendships as a result of Exercism
- Easier to explain (?)
- Simpler in terms of implementation (?)

In practice, our experience with community moderation is that the quality of feedback varies greatly and the negatives outweigh the positives. Much of the feedback is likely to be perceived as hostile, combative, or in other ways unsupportive. Additionally, lack of feedback is experienced as a negative (lack of support) rather than a neutral, especially because the product/experience depends on getting feedback.

### Conclusions

Based on the above points, we believe that the right choice for Exercism is to restrict the giving of feedback to mentors. However, we feel that it is essential that the benefits of community feedback are not lost. Specifically we believe it is crucial to provide an onramp so that anyone who wants to can train to become a mentor. Mentorship must not be elitist and must not be restricted to the "superstars" of communities. Throughout the site, the option to become a mentor must be clear and welcoming.

We considered the possible ways to "train" a mentor, and concluded that a mentorship track is the most Exercism-y way to do it. We propose creating a track that gives users moderation exercises where other mentors can then help them improve their moderating skills. This ensures that when a mentor graduates from that track, they will have come across a variety of different personalities and code issues, and be prepared to give feedback on a wide variety of exercises in an equally wide variety of situations.

Such a mentorship track will need to address both code skills and interaction skills. Interaction skills can be taught by anyone who has them (in any language), whereas the code skills would need to be imparted by people who are mentors in that specific language.

Having excellent moderation tools are of the utmost importance. We must have the ability to protect people from feeling attacked and harassed.
