### I have an idea about making the website better

We're currently working with professional user experience designers on rethinking the entire experience from scratch. Check out the [roadmap][] for more details about this.

### I have an idea about improving the command-line client (CLI)

Current specific discussions:

- Overall user experience with the CLI: [exercism/discussions#129][discussion-cli-ux].

Here are some helpful starter searches in the two repositories that contain ideas about the CLI:

- [exercism/cli][cli-issues]
- [exercism/discussions?cli][discussions-cli]

If the idea isn't being discussed yet, kick it off in the [exercism/cli][cli-new-issue].

### I have an idea about a brand-new exercise for Exercism

New exercise ideas are definitely welcome!  Here's how to ensure the idea lands in the right place:

- Check to see if the exercise is listed: https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises.
  - If it is there, but not in the language you'd like to solve it in, put in a request in [that particular language's repository][track-repos].
    - if you have the time and the desire, you can help *even more* by [implementing it][ref-help-track].
  - If it is not there, suggest it in [exercism/problem-specifications][common-new-issue].
    - if you have the time and the desire, you can help *even more* by [implementing it][how-to-new-exercise].
- If you know of a good source of potential new problems, please share: [exercism/problem-specifications#107][issue-exercise-ideas].

  - **instructions** of the exercise, you can make a difference by making the suggestion in the [exercism/problem-specifications repository][common-new-issue].
    - if you have the time and the desire, you can help *even more* by [fixing it][how-to-exercise-readmes].
