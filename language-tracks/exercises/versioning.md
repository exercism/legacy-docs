### Exercise Versioning

It's only when we get a bunch of people having conversations about the
solutions that we really discover what makes a problem interesting, and
in what way it can be improved.

Some changes to the test suites will invalidate existing solutions that people
have submitted.

We think this is totally fine, however sometimes people start leaving feedback
saying _this doesn't pass the tests_. This is technically true, but since the
solution passed the tests at the time it was written, it's generally more
useful to just discuss the code as it is, rather than enforce strict
adherence to the most recent version of the tests.

Some language tracks have implemented a simple, manual versioning system to
help avoid unnecessary discussions about failing the current test suites.

If the exercise is versioned, then the test suite will probably have a
_book-keeping_ type test at the very bottom that asserts against a value in
the reference solution. If the change you're making is backwards-incompatible,
then please increment the version in both the test suite and the reference
solution.
