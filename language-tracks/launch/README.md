# Launching a new language track

At this point you should [have a repository to work in](https://github.com/exercism/request-new-language-track/issues).

Before digging into code and documentation, you'll need to [make some decisions](/language-tracks/launch/decisions.md) about the track.

Having that sorted out, start [implementing the first exercise](/language-tracks/launch/first-exercise.md).
This is where we'll uncover any missed assumptions, tricky setup, or tweaks we'll need to make in order to support the language on Exercism.

Then implement a second exercise, perhaps [two-fer](http://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises/two-fer) or [leap](http://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/master/exercises/leap).
This will put you in a good spot to figure out basic [tooling and continuous integration](/language-tracks/launch/tooling-and-ci.md), and get the track into [preview-mode](/language-tracks/launch/preview-mode.md) on the site.

At this point you should be able to accept contributions from strangers.
Write some [contributing documentation](/language-tracks/documentation/for-contributors.md), decide on the next 10 exercises that should be implemented, and [open issues](/language-tracks/launch/open-issues.md) for each one, including enough context in each issue that someone could come in off the street and figure out what needs to be done to open a pull request.

Then put the word out that you're looking for help getting the track implemented.
With specific issues that contain all the necessary context it's very easy for people to drop in and be productive.
Some people will contribute just a bit, others will stick around and become invested in the track, and you'll find great co-maintainers.

Meanwhile, spend some time working on [preparing the track landing page](/language-tracks/launch/landing-page.md) to entice people to join the track once it's launched, and the [user-facing documentation](/language-tracks/documentation/for-consumers.md) to help them get started once they join.
If you're lucky, others will be contributing by now, and will get involved in getting all the words right.

Once you have about 10 exercises, you can start [beta testing the track](/language-tracks/launch/beta.md) and [finding mentors]().

We're still working out how many exercises we should have before launching a track.
We're probably looking at about 8 core exercises minimum, each of which should unlock 3 or so optional exercises.
