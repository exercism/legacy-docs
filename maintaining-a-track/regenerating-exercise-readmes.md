# Regenerating Exercise READMEs

In order to give maintainers more control over the contents and formatting of each exercise README, it is generated from a template that the maintainers control. However, in order to avoid having to reinvent the universe from scratch when porting a new exercise from a shared specification, this README can be generated based on the specification description and other metadata.

The command to regenerate all the READMEs is:

```
configlet generate .
```

See the [exercise READMEs][readmes] documentation for more details.
